# Problem Statement : 
Poor visibility of project-related data, productivity gaps caused by insufficient profile automation, collaboration and communication problems brought on by a lack of profile information, and poor project selection are just a few of the numerous concerns that come to mind. With the aid of a more engaging collaborative application, a profile management application can eliminate the majority of those pain points.

# Functionality & Concepts used :
• The App has a very simple and interactive interface using jetpack compose • Linear and Relative Layout : To align the sub views in a line and relative view to give layoutparam to the sub views that specifies where it should go relative to other views.
• Recyclerview with constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses cardview in constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
• Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons with setOnClickListener() made it easier for customer or user to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
• Kotlin coroutines: used to create asynchronous programs in a fluent way so that user will not face any difficulties while using the app. • Viewmodel and LiveData and Room Database 

# Future Scope :
We'll make an effort to reach various locations throughout the globe and provide them this service. With the assistance of the Government and Development Assistance, we may also promote this in the various institutions in the next years (DA)
